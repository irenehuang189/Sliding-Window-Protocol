Halo halo :) The whole manuscript is now pervaded by
such headlines. Speaking headlines are
not just title-like ("Reinforcement Learn-
ing"), but centralize the information given
in the associated section to a single sen-
tence. In the named instance, an appro-
priate headline would be "Reinforcement
learning methods provide feedback to the
network, whether it behaves good or bad".
However, such long headlines would bloat
the table of contents in an unacceptable
way. So I used short titles like the first one
in the table of contents, and speaking ones,
like the latter, throughout the text.
